DJarvis - Good or bad, an app to accompany you always!

DJarvis was made with the noble purpose of helping you cheer up or continue you're mood of relaxation. 
It integrates with the Microsoft Cognitive API to give the user a careful analysis of his/her feeling's and then alleivates, calms, or continues the current state of mind by playing music
with respect to a parameter called valence which is integrated with the Spotify Web API.
A valence parameter ranging from 0-1 helps convey the positivity of the song and compares with the Cognitive APIs detection of emotions of the person and this coherency helps achieve the ideal playlist whether the user is sad or happy.
